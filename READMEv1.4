Compared to v1.0 on CABLE website, version 1.2 only has a new Makefile which
preset all compiling options for various CMAR platforms.

********************************************************************************
Version 1.3

Compared to v1.2 on CABLE website, version 1.3 uses Peter Isaac's driver
which requires changes in cable_driver, cable_input and cable_parameters.
A namelist file (cable_nml) is added to the directory.
Files in the surface_data directory have their name changed to more 
meaningful ones, plus adding a soil_parameter file (data pulled out from code).
Moreover, Gab Abramowitz found a bug in cable_output and corrected the units
of NEE written to the netcdf file.
Furthermore, Gab introduced new R scripts in the testing directory.
Finally, Gab introduced the safe spin-up scheme using average precipitation.

cable_driver

1) removed initialisation of file names and program switches from beginning
   of program code and put into a namelist file
2) added declaration of namelist to program code
3) tidied up namelist file
4) added the following file names
    filename_LAI  - default LAI file, used if LAI not found in
                    the input file
    filename_type - global map of vegetation and soil types
    filename_veg  - vegetation parameters
    filename_soil - soil parameters
5) added the code to read the namelist file
6) added filename_veg, filename_soil and filename_type to call to load_params
7) added filename_LAI to get_met_data
8) passed the switch 'spinup' into subroutine calls of open_met_file and
   get_met_data; also passed 'spinConv' into get_met_data

cable_input

1) added filename_LAI to subroutine get_default_LAI and added filename_LAI
   to the two calls to get_default_LAI
2) added filename_veg, filename_soil and filename_type to subroutine
   load_parameters
3) added filename_veg and filename_soil to calls to default_params
4) added large section to find average precipitation for spinup

cable_parameters : default_params

1) moved the initialisation of froot from soil section to veg section
2) added filename_veg and filename_soil to subroutine default_params
3) put parameters for 9 soil types into a file with same basic format
   as vegetation parameters and put in code to read soil properties
   from file

cable_output

1) Corrected the units for NEE being written to output netcdf files.
2) Added the deallocation of the variable PrecipScale, which is used in the
   safe spin-up scheme.
3) When (a) Parameter and state values are loaded from a restart file (rather
   than from default) and (b) LAI is loaded from met file (rather than from 
   default), the pointer "gdpt" will not be associated with any target (used
   in the default loading by lat/lon routines) when it is deallocated.
   Fix: check that it is associated before deallocation.

Version 1.4

Put in Eva's modular snow scheme, which should behave the same as before.
Main changes are:
1) Variable met%precips renamed as met%precip_s for files
   cable_cbm.f90
   cable_checks.f90
   cable_input.f90
   cable_output.f90
   cable_soilsnow.f90
   cable_variables.f90
2) Major rewritting of cable_soilsnow.f90 to make it modular. It is also cleaned
   up to fit our new coding standard.

Following are Yingping's changes:
Within cable_cbm.f90, restricting the simple phenology parameterization to 
deciduous forests only. This improved NEE results for many non-deciduous sites.
It requires the introduction of a logical variable veg%deciduous and changes in
   cable_variables.f90
   cable_parameters.f90

The froot parameter values were removed from cable_parameters.f90 and
replaced by an equation to calculate its values based on the new read-in
parameter rootbeta. Together with new variables veg%vegcf (originally vegcf)
and veg%extkn (originally rad%extkn), they required corresponding changes in
   cable_checks.f90
   cable_input.f90
   cable_parameters.f90
   cable_variables.f90

Modified values in leaf reflectance and transmittance within cable_cbm.f90

Modified values in rhos in the input file def_soil_params.txt so that it
follows the relationship   rho = (1  - ssat) * 2650

Changed the range for a few variables in the check module:
   SWneti, NPP, GPP, xfang     (YP oct07)
   SnowDepth                   (EK nov07)
Introduced the range for new variables into the check module:
   extkn, wai, vegcf, rootbeta (YP oct07)
   c3                          (EK nov07)

This version starts to use IGBP vegetation types (instead of CASA types) and
the input format of the default veg_parm file was altered (in line with changes
for the online code). It is now called def_veg_params_igbp.txt. Other changes:
1) Added an alternative to read in new file format for IGBP veg parameters.
   cable_parameters.f90
2) Changed declaration of variables hardwired to 13 veg types (also found those
   hardwired to 9 soil types) to allocatable arrays, which are deallocated
   after use. Make allowance for IGBP without/with water bodies (16 and 17 types
   respectively).
   cable_carbon.f90
   cable_parameters.f90
3) Introduced nvegt and nsoil (number of vegetation and soil types respectively)
   into parameter list of some subroutines. The initial values are obtained
   from reading the default veg and soil parameter files in default_params,
   passed up load_parameters to the driver and down to cbm and finally passed
   to carbon_pl and soilcarb respectively.
   cable_carbon.f90
   cable_cbm.f90
   cable_driver.f90, cable_drivertxt.f90
   cable_input.f90
   cable_parameters.f90
4) N.B. If the met file you read in has the variable iveg, make sure it is in
   IGBP type as it will overwrite the default. The met files supplied in the
   package (under directory sample_met) in version 1.4 are named *_igbp.nc
   and therefore need corresponding change in the namelist (in R script for
   codes using netCDF files, but in file cabletxt.nml for codes using text
   files). Bondville does not need changes as cropland is type 12 in both
   CASA and IGBP, but the files are still renamed.
5) The input file containing veg and soil types for all global grids is now
   named VegSoil_Type_Global_igbp.csv and require a different READ statement
   in cable_parameters.f90 and also need corresponding change in the namelist.
   In addition, it now has C4 fraction values for each grid (preprocessed 
   using latitude and vegetation type criteria, and based on a 1x1 C4 fraction
   map from Still et al. (GBC, 2003). This file is the same as vegtype_igbp.dat
   in the online version which does not read the last few columns.

Finally, 2 bugs are fixed in the CABLEplots.R script (a) DJF NEE was adding MAM 
(instead of Dec) to JF, (b) sqerr should be an array.
